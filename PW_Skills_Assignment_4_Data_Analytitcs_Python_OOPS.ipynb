        "\n",
        "Ans: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach based on the concept of \"objects\", which contain data (attributes) and code (methods). It focuses on four main principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. OOP helps in organizing code, making it reusable, scalable, and easier to maintain. In Python, OOP is widely used in data analytics, software development, and building real-world applications.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans: In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the created objects will have. A class does not hold data itself but provides the structure for objects to store data and perform actions. In Python, a class is defined using the class keyword. Once a class is created, multiple objects (instances) can be made from it, each having its own values for the attributes defined in the class."

        "\n",
        "Ans: In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It is a self-contained unit that combines data (attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by its class. When a class is like a blueprint, an object is the actual product built from it. Each object can have different values for its attributes, but it shares the structure and behavior of the class. Objects allow real-world modeling and make code modular, reusable, and easier to manage."

        "\n",
        "Ans: Abstraction and encapsulation are key concepts in object-oriented programming. Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features, helping users focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. Encapsulation, on the other hand, binds data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricts access to internal details through access modifiers. While abstraction focuses on design and interfaces, encapsulation ensures data protection and code modularity."

        "Ans: Dunder methods in Python (short for “double underscore” methods) are special methods with names that start and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, or __len__. They enable custom behavior for built-in Python operations. For example, __init__ initializes an object, __str__ defines its string representation, and __add__ can be used to define addition behavior between objects. These methods allow classes to interact with Python syntax and functions in a more intuitive and powerful way."

It helps in code reusability and organization. The child class can also have its own features or override the parent’s methods. For example, if a class Animal has a method speak(), a class Dog can inherit from Animal and use or change the speak() method."

It allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method in their own way. For example, if different classes have a method called speak(), each class can define its own version. When you call speak() on an object, Python will run the correct version based on the object's class. This makes code more flexible and easier to manage."

This makes code more flexible, reusable, and easier to manage. For example, different classes can have a method with the same name, like draw(), but each class can implement it differently. You can then loop through different objects and call draw() without worrying about their specific class. This simplifies code and supports better design."
